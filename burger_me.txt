            Ingredient Synergy is based on lists of related ingredients, the more completed lists, the higher the score

        Ingredients from the completed burger appear equally spaced out on either side
    THE GAME PLAN
        Working Demo
            Movable Bottom Bun
            Falling Ingredients
                Apply Gravity
                Instantiate with random ingredient and position
            Each ingredient is dropped at the same rate within a set range
                meaning the more ingredients are chosen the harder the game becomes
            Figure out how to stick ingredients together as they stack on the bottom bun
            Condiment bottles glide in from the side, blast a random (but telegraphed) area
                Make sure condiment is applied to burger when the burger is in that area
                condiments function same as ingredients in that each condiment appears at the same rate (within a range) independant of other condiments
            Draw pixelated ingredients/condiments/condiment bottles
                Apply sprites to game objects
            Find kitchen stock photo to blur for the main game background
